Each floor has Up and Down buttons. When requested by one of them, the user will be able to select floors above/below the current floor respectively. 

When an empty cabin is going up/down to pick up people, it will not stop at intermediate floors. In later iterations we may allow it to stop according to some rules (should it stop if the Up/Down button pressed according to the current movement?)

When a cabin is moving with passengers then itâ€™s going to pick up passengers on intermediate floors consistent with the current movement. E.g. if the cabin is moving down passing the 7th floor, and the Down button is pressed on the 7th floor, the cabin is going to stop there, and all floors below 7 will be selectable.

These requirements imply one cabin, but there can be more than one in the future.
